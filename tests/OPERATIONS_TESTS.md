# Buckia Operations Tests Overview

This document provides an overview of the file operation tests in the `test_operations.py` file. These tests verify the basic functionality of individual file operations in the Buckia system.

## Test Descriptions

### `test_file_upload_download`

- **Purpose**: Tests basic file upload and download operations
- **Actions**:
  - Creates test files of different sizes (1KB, 100KB, 1MB)
  - Uploads each file to remote storage
  - Verifies files are present in remote storage listing
  - Downloads each file to a new location
  - Verifies downloaded files exist and have correct sizes
  - Deletes each file from remote storage
  - Verifies deletion operations succeed

### `test_file_listing`

- **Purpose**: Tests file listing operations
- **Actions**:
  - Uploads multiple files with a common prefix
  - Tests listing all files in remote storage
  - Verifies all uploaded files appear in the listing
  - Tests path-based listing (listing files under a specific prefix)
  - Verifies only files under the specific path appear in filtered listing
  - Cleans up by deleting test files

### `test_file_operations_with_special_characters`

- **Purpose**: Tests handling of filenames with special characters
- **Actions**:
  - Creates and uploads files with spaces, hyphens, underscores, and multiple dots in filenames
  - Verifies all files with special characters are correctly uploaded
  - Downloads files and verifies content integrity
  - Deletes files and verifies successful deletion
  - Ensures special characters don't cause issues in any file operations

### `test_binary_file_operations`

- **Purpose**: Tests operations with binary (non-text) files
- **Actions**:
  - Creates a small binary PNG image file
  - Uploads the binary file to remote storage
  - Downloads the binary file to a new location
  - Verifies file size matches the original
  - Compares binary content to ensure exact match with original
  - Deletes the binary file
  - Verifies deletion succeeds

## Key Verification Points

Throughout these tests, the following aspects are verified:

1. **Upload Success**: All files are successfully uploaded
2. **Download Success**: All files are successfully downloaded
3. **Delete Success**: All files are successfully deleted
4. **Content Integrity**: Downloaded files match the original in size and content
5. **Listing Accuracy**: Remote file listings correctly include all uploaded files
6. **Path-Based Listing**: Filtering by path correctly returns only files under that path
7. **Special Character Handling**: Files with special characters in filenames are handled correctly
8. **Binary File Support**: Binary files are transferred without corruption

These tests provide comprehensive coverage of the basic file operations, ensuring that each individual operation works correctly across different file types and naming patterns before testing the more complex synchronization operations.
